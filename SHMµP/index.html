			<h1>What's this all about</h1>

			<h3>Minimalism</h3>
			<h6>Blocks, blocks everywhere! But have no fear. No mining, no crafting involved.</h6>
			<p>The block is the elementary unit in the game. The player ship, enemies, bullets, everything is composed of blocks.<br/>
			Blocks are important for the gameplay, of course. They are what you will use to build your ship, making it unique. Each block has a particular effect on your ship, and so they do on enemies!</p>

			<h3>Procedural content</h3>
			<p>I am lazy, so this game includes 0 stages.<br/>
			The good news is, no stage means infinite stage: the enemies are generated on the fly, by a clever algorithm (soon&trade;).<br/>
			As time passes, the <i>difficulty</i> increases. By beating enemies, getting bonus and avoiding getting hit, the player increases his <i>skill-o-meter</i>. Waves will then adapt the way they generate enemies based on these 2 parameters, among others.<br/>
			The game relies heavily on random, but every run can be replayed: you just need to enter the same seed once again.</p>

			<h3>Scripting</h3>
			<p>Enemies are scripts.<br/>
			Waves are scripts.<br/>
			Scripts make the game, and anybody can make scripts.</p>

			<h1>How to play</h1>
			<p>Your ship does not do many things, but it does them nicely. Well, at first it does nothing at all, you'll need to give it a little help to get it started.<br/>
