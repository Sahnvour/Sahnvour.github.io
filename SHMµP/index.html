		<h1>Presentation</h1>
		<p><strong>SHMµP</strong> is a little game I work on during my spare time. I felt like it reached the point where I can show it, so here we go.<br/>
		It is by no means finished, but more like a demo at the current state; yet it is totally playable.
		</p>
		<p>
		It was inspired by classic arcade shoot them up games, with a penchant for <em>bullet hells</em>. I am no artist, so I thought about this block thing to make up the graphics of my game; I liked the idea to link the visual aspect to the gameplay.
		</p>

			<h1>What is this game about</h1>

			<h3>Minimalism</h3>
			<h6>Blocks, blocks everywhere! But have no fear. No mining, no crafting involved.</h6>
			<p>The block is the elementary unit in the game. The player ship, enemies, bullets, everything is composed of blocks.<br/>
			Blocks are important for the gameplay, of course. They are what you will use to build your ship, making it unique. Each block has a particular effect on your ship, and so they do on enemies!</p>

			<h3>Procedural content</h3>
			<p>I am lazy, so this game includes 0 stages.<br/>
			The good news is, no stage means infinite stage: the enemies are generated on the fly, by a clever algorithm (soon&trade;).<br/>
			As time passes, the <i>difficulty</i> increases. By beating enemies, getting bonus and avoiding getting hit, the player increases his <i>skill-o-meter</i>. Waves will then adapt the way they generate enemies based on these 2 parameters, among others.<br/>
			The game relies heavily on random, but every run can be replayed: you just need to enter the same seed once again.</p>

			<h3>Scripting</h3>
			<p>Enemies are scripts.<br/>
			Waves are scripts.<br/>
			Scripts make the game, and anybody can make scripts.</p>

			<h1>How to play</h1>
			<p>Your ship does not do many things, but it does them nicely. Well, at first it does nothing at all, you'll need to give it a little help to get it started.</p>
			<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">Before playing, you'll need to enter the build screen and create your ship.</div>
			<p>
			The <span class='block grey'></span> at the center of your ship is the <span class="label label-default">reactor</span>, the most important part. It has to be there, and it is the only hitbox of your ship: if enemies hit it your ship will be damaged, and loose external blocks. But the other blocks you added can be traversed by bullets and enemies with no problem.
			</p>
			<p>
			When killed, enemies sometimes drop <span class="label label-default">bonuses</span>, that's the way to gain new blocks for your ship. Just go over to loot them.
			</p>

			<hr/>

			<h6>Step 1</h6>
			<p>Launch the game, and click <span class="label label-default">PLAY</span></p>

			<h6>Step 2</h6>
			<p>Enter your <span class="label label-default">seed</span> with the keyboard. This will determine how the random behaves.</p>

			<h6>Step 3</h6>
			<p>Press <span class="label label-default">Enter</span> and add blocks to your ship by clicking them.</p>

			<h6>Step 4</h6>
